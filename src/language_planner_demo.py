# ## Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners:<br>Extracting Actionable Knowledge for Embodied Agents
# 
# This is the official demo code for our [Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners](https://huangwl18.github.io/language-planner/) paper. The code demonstrates how Large Language Models, such as GPT-3 and Codex, can generate action plans for complex human activities (e.g. "make breakfast"), even without any further training. The code can be used with any available language models from [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) and [Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) with a common interface.
# 
# **Note:**
# - It is observed that best results can be obtained with larger language models. If you cannot run [Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=downloads) models locally or on Google Colab due to memory constraint, it is recommended to register an [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) account and use GPT-3 or Codex (As of 01/2022, $18 free credits are awarded to new accounts and Codex series are free after [admitted from the waitlist](https://share.hsforms.com/1GzaACuXwSsmLKPfmphF_1w4sk30?)).
# - Due to language models' high sensitivity to sampling hyperparameters, you may need to tune sampling hyperparameters for different models to obtain the best results.
# - The code uses the list of available actions supported in [VirtualHome 1.0](https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/tree/v1.0.0)'s [Evolving Graph Simulator](https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/tree/v1.0.0/simulation). The available actions are stored in [`available_actions.json`](https://github.com/huangwl18/language-planner/blob/master/src/available_actions.json). The actions should support a large variety of household tasks. However, you may modify or replace this file if you're interested in a different set of actions or a different domain of tasks (beyond household domain).
# - A subset of the [manually-annotated examples](http://virtual-home.org/release/programs/programs_processed_precond_nograb_morepreconds.zip) originally collected by the [VirtualHome paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07011.pdf) is used as available examples in the prompt. They are transformed to natural language format and stored in [`available_examples.json`](https://github.com/huangwl18/language-planner/blob/master/src/available_examples.json). Feel free to change this file for a different set of available examples.

# ### Autoregressive Plan Generation
# Generate action plan autoregressively by mapping each action step to the closest available action.
# 
# The algorithm is summarized as follows:
# 1. Extract the most relevant human-annotated example by matching the task names (`Make breakfast` <-> `Make toast`)
# 2. Prompt the **Planning LM** with `[One Example Plan] + [Query Task] (+ [Previously Generated Actions])`
# 3. Sample **Planning LM** `n` times for single-step text output.
# 4. Rank the samples by `[Matching Score] + BETA * [Mean Log Prob]`, where
#     1. `[Matching Score]` is the cosine similarity to the closest allowed action as determined by **Translation LM**
#     2. `[Mean Log Prob]` is the mean log probabilities across generated tokens given by **Planning LM**
# 5. Append the closest allowed action of the highest-ranked sample to the prompt in Step 3
# 6. Return to Step 3 and repeat
